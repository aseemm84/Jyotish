# LearnHoro — Jyotiṣa reference and chart engine

A static website for learning and applying classical Vedic astrology, grounded in
*Bṛhat Parāśara Horā Śāstra*. Fourteen reference pages, a chart builder that computes
a forty-section technical report **entirely in the browser**, and a filterable table of
the 108 nakṣatra pādas.

No server. No API key. No account. No third-party calls. Works offline.

**Live:** https://aseemm84.github.io/Jyotish/

## Contents

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Build a Kundli** | `kundli.html` — birth details in, a 40-section report out |
| **Reference library** | 14 topic pages covering the BPHS framework |
| **108 Nakṣatra Pādas** | every pāda with a nine-graha grid and bhāva overlay (English + Hindi) |

### The reference library

Grahas · Dignity · Rashis · Bhavas · Lagna · Vargas · Aspects · Strength ·
Special Points · Yogas · Avasthas & Longevity · Dashas · Ashtakavarga

Each page cites BPHS by chapter and keeps three layers visibly distinct:
what the **verses** say, what the **translator** added, and what is **synthesis**
offered here. Where lineages disagree, the page says so rather than picking a side
silently.

### What the chart builder produces

**Charts** — rāśi in North and South Indian styles · navāṃśa · all sixteen vargas as
charts with their own lagnas · Chandra and Sūrya kuṇḍalī · Bhāva Chalit (equal cusps) ·
Bhāva Sripati (Porphyry cusps with bhāva spaṣṭa) · Ārūḍha Lagna · Kārakāṃśa in both
rāśi and navāṃśa · Bhāva, Horā and Ghaṭika lagnas · Sudarśana Chakra · Dhūmādi
upagrahas · ashtakavarga charts

**Position and strength** — grahas with degree, speed, dignity, compound status,
nakṣatra-pāda, avasthā and state · four avasthā schemes · bhāvas with lords and
occupants · graha dṛṣṭi · rāśi dṛṣṭi · argala · Ṣaḍbala with all six components and
their sub-parts · Bhāva Bala · Iṣṭa and Kaṣṭa phala · ṣoḍaśavarga strength index

**Ashtakavarga** — Bhinna and Sarva · the three śodhanas (Trikoṇa, Ekādhipatya,
Piṇḍa) · kakṣā transits · ashtakavarga computed inside D9 and D10

**Timing** — Vimśottarī to pratyantardaśā across the full 120 years (729 periods,
expandable) · Aṣṭottarī · Yoginī · gochara from the Moon with vedha · Sade Sati
timeline past and future · ingress and retrograde calendar · eclipses placed in the
chart · muhūrta day tools (Rāhu kālam, Yamaganda, Gulika kālam, choghaḍiyā)

**Context** — birth particulars with full time reductions · birth pañcāṅga ·
Avakhaḍa chakra · Bhayāta/Bhabhoga · the three friendship chakras · kārakas ·
ārūḍhas · yogas · current transits

**Views on top of the report** — the report opens on tabs, with the full forty sections one tab among them:

- **Overview** — a plain-language "chart at a glance" (lagna and its lord, the Moon, strongest and weakest grahas,
  weighted houses, yogas, the running period, the sky now, how secure the lagna is), each card linking to its
  section; and an interactive rāśi chart — select a planet to shade where it sits, what it aspects and what it
  rules, with its daśā dates and transit; select a house for its lord, occupants, glances and SAV
- **Now** — all five daśā levels with progress, the slow planets read from the Moon with ashtakavarga support and
  next ingress, the Sade Sati phase, and today's pañcāṅga, tārābala, Rāhu kālam and choghaḍiyā at the birth
  place or the viewer's own location
- **Life timeline** — daśās, Sade Sati and dhaiyā phases, and Jupiter, Saturn and nodal returns on one chart
  (next ten years or whole life), with the turning points of the coming decade
- **Reading path** — a seven-step first reading (lagna → lagna lord → Moon → strength → yogas → daśā →
  transits), each step pairing the method with what it finds in this chart
- **Life events** — log dated events; each shows the daśā and transits then and whether the period lords tie to
  that kind of event's houses, against a chance baseline. Kept in the browser only
- **Birth-time check** — the window of birth times over which the D1, D9, D10, D7, D12 and D60 lagnas hold, an
  hour-either-side ruler, the Moon's pāda window and how far daśā dates move per ten minutes, with one-click
  recasts at nearby times
- **Compatibility** — the Aṣṭakūṭa comparison of two Moons out of 36, with the commonly cited doṣa exceptions
  tested and the Mars placement noted, framed as a traditional method for study

Each section carries a plain-language **study note** composed from the site's own
rules, linking back to the reference page the rule came from. A brief/detailed toggle
controls depth. Print to PDF, download the JSON, or copy it.

## How it computes

| Layer | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Sun, planets | VSOP87, via [astronomy-engine](https://github.com/cosinekitty/astronomy) (MIT) |
| Moon | Improved Lunar Ephemeris (1954), same library |
| Lunar nodes | mean node, standard polynomial |
| Ayanāṃśa | Lahiri, quadratic fitted to Swiss Ephemeris |
| Sunrise / sunset | disc centre at the geometric horizon, unrefracted — the Jyotiṣa convention |
| Everything else | derived here from those positions using the classical rules |

The library is inlined, so the page is a single self-contained file.

### Accuracy, measured

Validated against Swiss Ephemeris and against printed charts from Parashara's Light 9.0:

- **Ayanāṃśa** — within 0.01″ of Swiss Ephemeris Lahiri
- **Planetary longitudes** — 13–19″ of Swiss Ephemeris, across all seven
- **Lagna** — within 0.3′
- **Sunrise, Iṣṭakāla, Bhabhoga, tithi, yoga, karaṇa, Avakhaḍa, Saṃvat** — match
  Parashara's Light exactly
- **Vimśottarī balance at birth** — within one day
- **Ashtakavarga** — 84/84 bindus and SAV identical to an independent engine; total 337
- **Yogas** — 15/15 present/absent verdicts agree with an independent engine

For scale: a nakṣatra pāda spans 3000″ and a D60 aṃśa 1800″, so arcsecond-level
differences never move a placement.

### Stated simplifications

Labelled in the page itself, not buried here:

- **Dṛk Bala** uses the graded whole-sign glance, not the exact Virupa-by-angle formula
- **Nathonnatha** is measured from clock noon, not local apparent noon
- **Vimśopaka** is a transparent weighted index, not the canonical scheme
- **Ārūḍha** exception cases follow the rule on the Special Points page; other software differs
- **Śayanādi** avasthās are omitted — they need the person's name-syllable
- **Piṇḍa** multipliers and Ekādhipatya rules are the commonly cited set; editions vary

### Not implemented, deliberately

The rāśi-daśā family — Kālachakra, Chara/Narayana, Sthira, Niryāṇa Śūla, Dṛg,
Navāṃśa, Lagna-Kendrādi — genuinely differs between lineages. Rather than present one
variant as authoritative, they are left out and the Dashas page explains the
disagreement. KP sub-lords are absent for the same reason: a different system, not a
BPHS one.

Longevity and Maraka timing are computable and deliberately excluded from the tool.
The Avasthas & Longevity page teaches the method academically; the report does not
output a lifespan.

## City search

Bundled and offline: 44,426 places from GeoNames (CC BY 4.0) — 34,006 worldwide towns
plus 10,420 Indian localities from the postal set, giving roughly 15 km average spacing
across India. Historical spellings resolve (Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore, Poona,
Benares, Trivandrum). Selecting a city sets the coordinates and the **UTC offset that
applied on the birth date**, including historical daylight saving.

`cities.json` loads lazily on the first search and is then cached. It needs `http(s)`;
opening the folder directly from disk disables search but nothing else.

---

## Running it

A plain static site — no build step, no dependencies, no server code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aseemm84/Jyotish.git
cd Jyotish
python3 -m http.server 8000     # open http://localhost:8000
```

Every page is a single self-contained HTML file with CSS and JavaScript inlined.
Deployment is GitHub Pages from the repository root.

## Scope

This is an **educational reference on traditional doctrine**. It is not a scientific
claim and not a prediction about any person. Nothing here forecasts health, illness,
lifespan, wealth, marriage, children or misfortune; classical indications are
conditional by nature and are presented as material for study.

For medical, legal, financial, relationship or safety matters, consult a qualified
professional.
